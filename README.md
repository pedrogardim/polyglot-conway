# Polyglot Conway

### About this repo ℹ️

After being delighted by the genious and simplicity of Conway's Game of Life, I decided to try to implement it myself. But why stop there? Implementing it is a great way to get used to a programming language's syntax and peculiarities.
So I created this repo to implement Conway's Game of Life as a way to learn, improve my skills, or try new _trendy_ programming languages. Some considerations:

- I want to do the simplest implementation as I can, only with 1, 2 or 3 files, displayin . That's why I'm doing a **monolith repo** for all the programming languages, as multiple repos with 2 files is a little overkill.
- I languages where OOP is optional I might not use it, it depends on the reason I'm learning it.

### About Game of Life 🦠

> The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician [John Horton Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) in 1970.

> The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

> - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
> - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
> - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
